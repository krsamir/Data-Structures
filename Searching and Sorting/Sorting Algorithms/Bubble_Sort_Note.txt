We start at the front of the array and compare each pair of numbers.
If they are out of order(ascending order), we swap them. 
Then, we move to the next pair and repeat the same process.

Let's again consider the following array:
4,9,7,1,3,6,5
We first compare 4 and 9. Are they in order? Yes, so we don't do anything and move to the next pair.
Now, we have 9 and 7. They are out of order, so we swap them! This gives us:
4,7,9,1,3,6,5
Now, the next pair is 9 and 1. Again, they are out of order, so we swap them
4,7,1,9,3,6,5
If we keep going down the array, we will eventually turn our array into the following
4,7,1,3,6,5,9

This sorting algorithm is therefore called Bubble Sort because we continuously swap the largest element in the unsorted 
portion to the right until it is in its right position; 
the repetively swapping resembles the way bubbles rising to the surface.
