Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out).

While doing stack implementation of Linked List we insert elements from first. So it works as pushing data into stack.
Method Used: public void insertFirst(long dd)

While deleting we delete nodes from the first (which is same as popping data one by one).
Method Used:  public long deleteFirst()

So the Data first inserted becomes the last node in the list and the last inserted node by user becomes the first node. While popping/deleting we pop the topmost or the last element.
